    <h1>Naked Eggs Benedict</h1>

            <p>These naked eggs Benedict are a stripped-down version that involves no poaching of eggs,
             and they are not covered in heavy Hollandaise sauce, 
             but are sauced with a lighter lemon butter sauce. And yet, 
            the taste is virtually identical to classic eggs Benedict.</p>
           

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons melted butter</li>
            <li>4 round or oval slices deli ham (about 2 ounces)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs/li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt/li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>  
    
     <h3>Steps</h3>   
        
        <ol>
                <p><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                    Grease 2 (5 ounce) ramekins (or 2 wells of a standard muffin tin) 
                    with melted butter.</li></p>
                
                <p><li>Line each ramekin with two slices of ham, 
                    being sure to get the edges even around the top. </li></p>
               
                <p><li>Crack 1 egg into a small bowl; gently transfer to a ham-lined 
                    ramekin; repeat with the second egg. Season each egg with 
                    salt and cayenne, to taste.</li></p>
                
                <p><li>Bake in the preheated oven until the whites are just barely set, 
                    and the yolks are still soft and a little runny, 
                    20 to 25 minutes. The eggs will continue to cook and set more 
                    firmly once removed from the oven if left in the hot ramekins.</li></p>

                <p><li>When eggs have 10 minutes cook time remaining, 
                    make lemon butter sauce. Add lemon juice, water, and salt to a 
                    small pan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, 
                    and simmer until liquid has reduced by about half, 1 to 2 minutes.</li></p>

                <p><li>Reduce heat to lowest setting and add butter slices. 
                    Start swirling and shaking the pan until butter is almost 
                    fully emulsified, then turn off the heat. 
                    Continue swirling pan until butter is entirely melted. Taste; 
                    add cayenne or hot sauce if using. Keep pan in a warm spot until 
                    needed. Sauce will thicken slightly as it cools</li></p>
                
                <p><li>Toast and butter English muffins, transfer baked ham and eggs 
                    onto muffin halves, and spoon warm sauce over. S
                    prinkle with chives and serve immediately.</li></p>
